# summer25_mapworkshop
Files hosted for the 2025 Summer Mapping Workshop hosted by the Stanford Geospatial Center.

In this repo, there is GeoJSON data from two different maps: John Snow's map of London water pumps, and Alexandre Descubes' 1880 map of Mauritius, and a test HTML page from the final day of work.
